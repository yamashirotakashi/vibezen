# Why Anthropic Provider is Disabled in VIBEZEN

## Overview

The Anthropic provider (Claude models) is deliberately disabled in VIBEZEN. This is a design decision to avoid self-referential usage and ensure VIBEZEN maintains objectivity in its quality assurance role.

## Reasoning

### 1. Avoiding Self-Referential Loops
- VIBEZEN is designed to guide AI code generation
- If VIBEZEN uses Claude (Anthropic) to analyze code that might be generated by Claude, it creates a self-referential loop
- This could lead to biased quality assessments and reduced effectiveness

### 2. Ensuring Provider Diversity
- By using alternative providers (OpenAI, Google), VIBEZEN can provide more objective quality assurance
- Different AI providers have different strengths and perspectives
- This diversity helps catch issues that might be missed by self-assessment

### 3. Best Practices for AI Quality Assurance
- Industry best practice suggests using different AI systems for generation vs validation
- This separation of concerns improves overall quality
- Prevents "marking your own homework" scenarios

## Alternative Providers

VIBEZEN supports these excellent alternatives:

### OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Excellent code generation capabilities
- Strong reasoning and analysis
- Wide language support

### Google (Gemini Pro)
- Large context window (up to 1M tokens)
- Multi-modal capabilities
- Fast response times

## Implementation Details

The Anthropic provider is disabled at multiple levels:
1. **Registry Level**: Not auto-discovered even if API key is present
2. **Import Level**: Not imported in provider modules
3. **Configuration Level**: Removed from default configurations
4. **Documentation Level**: Marked as disabled in all docs

## For Users Who Need Anthropic

If you have a specific use case that requires Anthropic:
1. The provider code still exists in the codebase
2. You can manually enable it by modifying the registry
3. However, this is not recommended for quality assurance tasks
4. Consider using Anthropic for generation and VIBEZEN (with other providers) for validation

## Future Considerations

This decision may be revisited in the future if:
- New approaches to avoid self-referential issues emerge
- Provider capabilities significantly change
- Community feedback suggests alternative approaches

For now, VIBEZEN remains focused on providing objective, multi-provider quality assurance without self-referential complications.
