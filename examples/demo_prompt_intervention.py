# VIBEZEN's thinking prompt that would be injected BEFORE code generation
VIBEZEN_THINKING_PROMPT = """
You are about to implement a feature based on a specification. 
Before writing any code, you must thoroughly understand what is being asked.

IMPORTANT: Take time to think step-by-step about this specification.

## Required Thinking Steps

You MUST think through AT LEAST 5 steps before proceeding:

1. **Core Requirements**: What exactly is being asked? List each requirement explicitly.
2. **Implicit Requirements**: What requirements are implied but not stated?
3. **Constraints**: What limitations or boundaries exist?
4. **Edge Cases**: What edge cases need to be handled?
5. **Dependencies**: What external systems or components are involved?

For each step, you must:
- State your current understanding
- Identify any ambiguities
- Note any assumptions you're making
- Consider if you need to revise previous steps

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

DO NOT:
- Skip understanding to start coding immediately
- Make assumptions without stating them explicitly
- Ignore edge cases because they seem unlikely
- Add features not in the specification
- Hardcode values that should be configurable
"""

# VIBEZEN's implementation guidance prompt
VIBEZEN_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT = """
Now implement the user service with these CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. NO hardcoded values - use configuration or parameters
2. Implement ONLY what's specified - no extra features
3. Handle errors appropriately
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Write clean, readable code

Remember:
- Database connection details should come from configuration
- API keys should NEVER be hardcoded
- Timeouts should be configurable
- Use environment variables or config files

Provide the implementation:

# VIBEZEN's validation prompt

Before finalizing this code, you must validate it against 
the specification and quality standards.

STOP and THINK: Does this code truly meet the requirements?

## Validation Checklist

Go through EACH item carefully:

### Specification Compliance
- [ ] Does the code implement ALL required features?
- [ ] Does it implement ONLY the required features (no extras)?
- [ ] Are all edge cases from the spec handled?

### Code Quality
- [ ] Are there any hardcoded values? List them: ___
- [ ] Is error handling implemented properly?
- [ ] Is the code testable?
- [ ] Are functions/classes appropriately sized?

### Anti-Patterns
- [ ] Is the code just trying to pass tests?
- [ ] Are there any shortcuts taken?
- [ ] Is there duplicated logic?

For any unchecked items, you MUST fix them before proceeding.
